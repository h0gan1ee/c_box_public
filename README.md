# C-Box

## Overview

Here is the official public repository of C-Box, an anshin box for himitsu, utilizing state-of-arts cryptography algorithms.

Well, it's just an Flutter app I build for myself (because I feel insecure).

Notice that the app was built from a private repository of C-Box, which might have a pretty tiny (even no) difference from the public repository.

## Contribution

Sorry, since the app is developed for my very own purpose, I prefer to have complete control on it.

But you're welcome to fork this repository.
